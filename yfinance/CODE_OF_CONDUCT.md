# Code of Conduct

## Submitting a new issue

* Search through existing Issues and Discussions, in case your issue already exists and a solution is being developed.
* Ensure you read & follow the template form.
* Consider you may be the best person to investigate and fix.

## Contributing to an existing Issue

* Read the entire thread.
* Ensure your comment is contributing something new/useful. Remember you can simply react to other comments.
* Be concise:
  - use the formatting options
  - if replying to a big comment, instead of quoting it, link to it
